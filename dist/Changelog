Version 1.1.2:
	Bug fixes:
	- When continuing reading after detecting an invalid character conversion,
	  some or all of the text leading up to the invalid character was discarded.

Version 1.1.1:
	Fix build on C++14 and later compilers.

Version 1.1.0:
	New features:
	- The base config, loaded before the user config from (by default)
	  /usr/share/tilde/base.config, now accepts the same configuration as the user
	  config.
	- The list of recent files is stored, such that closing and restarting Tilde
	  retains the list of recent files. This is limited to the last 100 files, to
    keep the storage space and processing required small.
	- When opening files that were opened before, the cursor is set back to its
	  last used position. This is limited to the last 100 files, to keep the
	  storage space and processing required small.

Version 1.0.3:
	Bug fixes:
	- Errors during saving files on exit would not be presented to the user.

Version 1.0.2:
	Bug fixes:
	- Tilde would leave tilde-backup-?????? files when saving files on exit.

Version 1.0.1:
	Bug fixes:
	- Writing of files has been completely re-written to ensure correct
	  preservation of permissions and ownerships of the file.

Version 1.0.0:
	This release is the first based on libt3widget 1.0.0. It does not provide
	new features.

Version 0.4.3:
	New features:
	- A new dialog is available that shows the codepoints under the cursor.

	Bug fixes:
	- Allow Private-Use Area characters in input and output without substitution.

Version 0.4.2:
	This release is a re-release of 0.4.1 which removes a non-functional file.

Version 0.4.1:
	Bug fixes:
	- Rewrite files in place if the owner of the file would be changed by
	  creating the file anew. This is a short-term solution for fixing
	  accidental ownership changes due to the scheme used by Tilde to prevent
	  file corruptions.
	- Guard against off-of-line cursor positions in finding next brace. This
	  could cause infinite loops in some cases.

Version 0.4.0:
	New features:
	- Allow writing files if the directory they are in is not writable for the
	  current user. This is ever so slightly more risky than creating a
	  temporary file and moving it over the existing one, which is the default
	  behavior.
	- Add menu items for the new Paste Selection (which pastes the X11 primary
	  selection) and for the new Delete Line actions.
	- Make it possible to disable claiming the primary selection, and to
	  automatically disable this when running over SSH. When running over SSH
	  on high-latency connections and while running a clipboard manager
	  locally, the primary selection claiming can make Tilde work slowly.

	Bug fixes:
	- Default values are now handled properly in the Interface dialog.
	- Remove terminal specific options if they are no longer different from the
	  defaults.

Version 0.3.9:
	Minor updates to Makefile.in for compatibility with Debian packaging.

Version 0.3.8:
	New features:
	- Files can be opened at a specific position, by appending line (and
	  column) number(s). This allows jumping to positions indicated by programs
	  processing text files such as compilers.
	- Allow changing the default interface attributes from the Interface
	  Options dialog

	Bug fixes:
	- Validate the attribute names used in the config file.

Version 0.3.7:
	Bug fixes:
	- Make the dialogs for stepped actions (save, load, quit) abort when the
	  user closes the dialog by using the escape key. Failing to do so would
	  result in failure to reset the terminal and random crashes.

Version 0.3.6:
	Re-release of version 0.3.5 to fix build problems.

Version 0.3.5:
	New features:
	- Added "toggle line comment" functionality.

	Bug fixes:
	- When the syntax highlighting changes through saving the file under a new
	  name, the screen is now correctly updated.
	- Syntax highlighting is now changed when a file is saved under a new name.
	- Reading in background colors from the configuration file did not work
	  for most colors.
	- Better handling of several signals, ensuring that the terminal won't be
	  left in an unusable state.

Version 0.3.4:
	Re-release of version 0.3.3 to update the configure script.

Version 0.3.3:
	Bug fixes:
	- Warn users about attempting to write a read-only file.
	- Improve warnings about encoding problems when saving.
	- Correctly set the "Comment keyword" style.

Version 0.3.2:
	Bug fixes:
	- Correctly handle errors in conversion when loading files. When the
	  converter failed in unexpected ways Tilde would crash.

Version 0.3.1:
	Bug fixes:
	- Correctly handle non-existent files on load and save. Previous version
	  accidentally reintroduced the behaviour reported in bug 14.

Version 0.3.0:
	New features:
	- Detect instances of Tilde on the same terminal that have been suspended.

	Bug fixes:
	- Use realpath function to determine the name of files, rather than the
	  incorrect method used previously.
	- Don't expand autocompletion to word under the cursor (#15).

Version 0.2.2:
	New features:
	- When opening a non-existing file from the command line, the message
	  stating that Tilde could not open the file is now suppressed (#14).

	Bug fixes:
	- Compile with Large File Support if such support is available on the
	  platform.

Version 0.2.1:
	Bug fixes:
	- Fix invalidation of highlighting information, such that highlighting is
	  correctly updated on edits.

Version 0.2.0:
	New features:
	- 256 color mode is now supported.
	- Colors are now configurable from the Options/Interface menu.

Version 0.1.15:
	Bug fixes:
	- Explicitly use t3_widget namespace qualifier for key_t to prevent build
	  failures on some platforms.

Version 0.1.14:
	New features:
	- Matching brace highlighting and go to matching brace function.
	- Tilde now tries to preserve ACLs and other extended attributes (requires
	  libacl and libattr).

	Bug fixes:
	- Try to load the correct config file on errors in the configuration file.
	- Use -V as option for version information, rather than -v.

Version 0.1.13:
	New features:
	- Added an option to allow specification of the encoding on the command
	  line, or ask for encoding on start-up.
	- Handle BOMs on loading of UTF-8 files.

	Bug fixes:
	- Properly handle the start of a file such that BOMs are correctly
	  interpreted.

Version 0.1.12:
	Bug fixes:
	- Use correct name for UTF-8 with BOM converter.

Version 0.1.11:
	New features:
	- An option has been added to show tabs.
	- Follow libt3widget API change.

	Bug fixes:
	- Fix a segmentation fault that would occur on using the mouse in the
	  Input Handling dialog.
	- Added "Indent aware home key" configuration option.

Version 0.1.10:
	New features:
	- Use the new XDG Base Directory Specification support functions in
	  libt3config to use configuration file in the correct directory.
	- Use the new libt3highlight language-detection features.

Version 0.1.9:
	New features:
	- Follow libt3highlight API changes for libt3highlight 0.2.0.

	  of those files.

	Bug fixes:
	- Choosing a new highlighting language would cause a segmentation fault.

Version 0.1.4:
	New features:
	- Added a "strip trailing spaces on save" option, and a "strip trailing
	  spaces" entry in the Tools menu.
	- Autocomplete from existing text.
